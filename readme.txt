Scripts for gathering twitter data:
- twitter_search.py
- twitter_stream.py

In terminal, run:

$ python twitter_search.py > twitter_search_results.txt

to get text file of twitter results. (Need config file with authentication keys, which is not included).

First project attempts:
- Located in the ‘initial attempt notebooks’ directory*

* Many of these notebooks were for initial data set building and do include useful things like geocoding and data-formatting that made later analysis possible.

Most up to date notebooks (as of Aug 25, 2016):
- redsox-analysis.ipynb
- yankees-analysis.ipynb**

** yankees-analysis.ipynb is an analogous notebook to redsox-analysis.ipynb but does not yet include the Predicting Wins section, with regression and classification attempts. The same methods would be applied to both notebooks, but the classification methods on the Redsox data need much more work before they can be used on alternate datasets.


IF YOU LOOK AT ONE NOTEBOOK

It should be redsox-analysis.ipynb, since it’s the most fully-fleshed out notebook that involves a lot of work that is not related to building the initial data set.
